# Lorenz System Research

This repository contains Python implementations of the Lorenz 63 and Lorenz 96 systems. The project includes test suites to ensure the correctness of the implementations and Jupyter notebooks for visualizing the chaotic behavior of these systems.

## Project Structure

- `src/lorenz_systems`: Contains the core Python source code for the Lorenz models.
- `tests`: Includes test suites for validating the Lorenz system implementations.
- `notebooks`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for visualizing the Lorenz systems.
